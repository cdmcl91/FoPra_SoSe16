\section{Monolayer Preparation}

\begin{comment}
In this section we explain our experimental procedure. This experiment had two parts of the proceddure, namely, sample making and measurement contact angle of samples to evaluate the quality of sample and identify the thiol. 
first part, we made SAM and this procedure was adapted from Sigma-Aldrich.

, thus, in this experiment we used this method.
In general, adsorption is performed in 10-1000 mil-mol/L solutions of thiols, dithiols,
dialkyldisulfides (in general S-S bonds break upon adsorption and thiolate SAMs are obtained) and dialkylsulfides in different solvents, depending on the nature of the molecule.
Mixed monolayers may be formed if the solution contains two or more different thiols.
Each of the molecules that constitute the building blocks of the system can be
divided into 3 different parts (Fig.\,\ref{sam1}(b)):
the head-group (linking group), the backbone (main chain), and the specific terminal (active) group. The head-group guides the self-assembly process on each type of substrate, linking the hydrocarbon chain (of variable length) to the metal surface through a strong bond.
The interactions among backbone hydrocarbon chains (involving van der Waals and hydrophobic forces) ensure an efficient packing of the monolayer and contribute to stabilize the structures with increasing chain length.
The terminal group confers specific properties to the surface (hydrophilic or hydrophobic), and can also be used to anchor different molecules, biomolecules, or nanostructures by weak interactions or covalent bonds.

For cost and stability reasons, one of the most widely studied systems of SAMs are gold-alkylthiolate monolayers (Fig.\,\ref{sam1}(a)).
The molecules that make up the monolayer can be roughly divided into three sections(Fig.\,\ref{sam1}(b)). The so-called "head-group" combines the gold layer and the remainder of the molecule (carbon-hydrogen bonds) through a strong bond. The backbone hydrogen chain has the function of the van der Waals interactions and generally increasing the length of the backbone chain leads to the stability of the monolayers.
The terminal group functions ultimately determine specific properties of surface. It can be for instance hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Furthermore it can also and serves a node with other molecules which can be linked by covalent bonds.

\subsection{Determine necessary amounts and concentration of thiol solution}

First, we calculated the total volume of thiol solution needed to make the number of samples desired and the total amount of thiol needed to prepare desired amount of thiol solution as follows. We used a powder chemical reagent (204.37 g/mol) and a liquid chemical reagent ($138.23 \ {\rm g/mol}$ and $1.032 \ {\rm g/mL})$, respectively. 

Mass of thiole is given by 
$ {\rm Total\ volume \times Consentration \times Molecular \ Weight}$, namely,

\begin{equation}
 m\, [{\rm g}]=V \, [{\rm L}] \cdot c \, \left[ \frac{{{\rm mol}}}{\rm L}\right] \cdot 
\text{Molecular Weight} \left[ \frac{\rm g}{{\rm mol}}\right]
\end{equation}
Where MW is the Molecular Weight of the thiol, and c is the concentration.
In this time we would make a thiol solution for 10 mL with 1 mil mol/L, so the prepared mass of thiol is 
\begin{eqnarray}
m\, [{\rm g}]=10\times 10^{-3}\cdot 1\times 10^{-3} 
\cdot  204.37  \nonumber
=204.37 \times 10^{-5} \, {\rm g}
\end{eqnarray}

Similarly, the prepared liquid volume of thiol is

\begin{eqnarray}
 l\, [{\rm L}] &=& V \, [{\rm L}] \cdot c \, \left[ \frac{{{\rm mol}}}{\rm L}\right] \cdot 
\frac{\rm Molecular \ Weight}{\rm Density} \left.  \left[ \frac{\rm g}{{\rm mol} }\right/\frac{\rm g}{\rm L}\right] \nonumber \\
& =& 10\times 10^{-3}\cdot 1\times 10^{-3} \cdot  \frac{138.23}{1.032\times 10^{3}} \nonumber \\
&=& 133.944 \times 10^{-8} \, {\rm l} \simeq 1.3 \, \mu \rm L
\end{eqnarray}

Therefore, we prepared first a powder of $204.37 \times 10^{-5} \, \rm g$, measured using an electronic scale. Second, a liquid sample of $1.3 \, \mu  \rm L$ measured using a micropipette.



\subsection{Prepare Thiol Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item First of all, we cleaned all laboratory apparatus, namely, beakers, tweezers and so on with ethanol, by rinsing them 2-3 times.
 \item We prepared three gold coated substrates for the base of SAM and cleaned them in a ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes at 37 kHz.
 \item We dispense respectively the powder or liquid of thiol into the solvent and made two types of thiol solutions with 1 mil mol/l for 10 ml using the amounts calculated above. We sonicated these solutions for 3 minutes to dissolve the thiols evenly.
 \item After dissolved, we dispensed the $3 \, \mu \rm l$ solutions into each sample containers. Therefore we made 3 kinds of solutions, or one was the solution made by a powder thiol reagent, another was by a liquid thiol reagent, and the other was mixed the above two ones equally. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Sample Self-Assembly}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item We immersed three gold substrates into the three different sample containers respectively.  
%\end{enumerate}
%\subsection{Sample S}
%\begin{enumerate}
 \item We placed the samples in clean petri dish individually and backfilled petri dishes with dry nitrogen to avoid oxidized. Subsequently we put lids on the petri dishes, sealed them with parafilm and stored them in a fume hood. They will be stored for around 24 hours to ensure the monolayers can fully assemble.
\end{enumerate}
So, we finished to set up our samples. And hereafter we used samples from the previous group to continue the process.


\subsection{Terminate Self-Assembly}
After took the samples out from the cases we rinsed with solvent and dried them with nitrogen gas. Then we sonicated the samples for 10 minutes with ethanol. The frequency is 37 kHz with 50 \% power output and dried them with a stream of dry nitrogen. This concludes the sample preparation process.
