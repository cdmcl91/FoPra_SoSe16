\section{Introduction}


Self Assembly is a key mechanism for the development of bottom-up nanotechnology. Self assembly monolayers are on of the first successful implementations of such a self-assembly process. Self assembly monolayers are comprised of a single layer of molecules exhibiting large scale ordering, which have arranged themselves on a substrate and exhibit long term stability.

\subsection{Applications}

Popular applications for self assembly monolayers are the modification of surface properties, for example wetting characteristics. This can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as anti-stick layers etc.

This report is divided into two major sections, reflecting the two experimental Procedure performed for this Lab course. The first section explores the assembly of monolayers on a substrate. The second part concerns the study of wetting characteristics of the samples prepared in the First part (or rather those prepared by our colleagues). We conclude our report with a discussion of literature on the stability of mixed monolayers.
