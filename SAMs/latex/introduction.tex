\section{Introduction}

Self Assembly is a key mechanism for the development of bottom-up nanotechnology. Self assembly monolayers are on of the first successful implementations of such a self-assembly process. Self assembly monolayers are comprised of a single layer of molecules exhibiting large scale ordering, which have arranged themselves on a substrate and are thermodynamically stable.
