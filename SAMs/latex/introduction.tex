\section{Introduction}


Self Assembly is a key mechanism for the development of bottom-up nanotechnology. Self assembly monolayers are on of the first successful implementations of such a self-assembly process. Self assembly monolayers are comprised of a single layer of molecules exhibiting large scale ordering, which have arranged themselves on a substrate and exhibit long term stability.

\subsection{Applications}

Popular applications for self assembly monolayers are the modification of surface properties, for example wetting characteristics. This can be used for a wide variety of applications, such as anti-stick layers etc.

This report is divided into two major sections, reflecting the two experimental Procedure The first section explores the
